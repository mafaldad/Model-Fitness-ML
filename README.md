# Project Title: Model Fitness Customer Engagement & Churn Prediction

**Overview:** This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a gym chain, Model Fitness, by analyzing customer data and identifying key factors influencing churn. The goal is to develop a customer retention strategy based on the insights from data analytics. The project uses machine learning to predict churn and clustering techniques to create customer segments. These insights help target specific groups with tailored strategies to boost engagement and reduce churn.

**Key Skills & Concepts:**

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted detailed data analysis to identify patterns and key factors influencing customer churn.
* Churn Prediction Model: Built a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of customer churn for the upcoming month, using features like contract length, class attendance, and additional services.
* Clustering Analysis: Clustering techniques were used to segment customers into groups with similar behaviors and attributes, such as contract duration and engagement levels.
* Customer Retention Strategy: Developed personalized marketing strategies to reduce churn and increase engagement for each customer segment, focusing on high-risk groups.
* Data Visualization: Used data visualization to illustrate customer behavior patterns, cluster characteristics, and key drivers of churn.

**Key Insights:**

* High-Risk Clusters: Identified clusters of customers (Clusters 2 and 3) that have shorter contract periods, fewer additional charges, and lower engagement, leading to a higher probability of churn.
* Engaged Customers: Clusters 0 and 4 showed higher loyalty, with more extended contract periods, regular class participation, and higher use of additional services, resulting in lower churn rates.
* Targeted Retention Strategies: Developed personalized marketing strategies for high-risk clusters, such as offering discounts for longer subscription lengths and incentives for attending more classes.

**Tools Used:**
* Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn): Data cleaning, model building, and visualization.
* Machine Learning: Built a classification model for predicting churn.
* Clustering (K-Means): To segment customers into meaningful clusters for targeted retention strategies.
